From simple html and css to complex flutter and next.js projects, I’ve learned a lot. Learning new things is a big part of what I do.I love staying up to date with the latest trends in tech. I’m also pretty good at solving problems and communicating with others, which comes in handy when working on team projects. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me wathcing some youtube videos, movies, anime, trying out new things or just playing games. These hobbies help me relax and keep my creative juices flowing, which actually makes me a better problem-solver.',
